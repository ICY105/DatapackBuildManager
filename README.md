# DatapackBuildManager
A simple build system for managing dependencies of Minecraft Datapacks written in Python, sort of like a make file for datapacks. It currently automates:
* Downloading dependencies from a URL (local files are also supported)
* Cleaning datapack of dangleing files
* Copying dependencies into datapack, merging files where pratical
* Integrating function tags
* Upgrading versioned libraries build version (doesn't cover all edge cases, you will need to check what does and does not get updated)

As with any tool that could potentially destroy your project, please take backups (I mean, you are using git, right?)

Usage:
```
Setup your dependencies.json file (see example in repo)

Run this from command line for basic operation:
    python build-datapack.py <datapack>

For advanced operation, add -h to see flags:
    python build-datapack.py -h

As of v1.2, it is recommended to use the new -o flag.
This will build your datapack into a new file, instead of modifying it directly.
    python build-datapack.py <datapack directory> -o <output directory>
```

# Known Libraries
These are datapack libraries that work with DatapackBuildManager. If you know of a library that should be on this list, please contact me.

If an end-user has several datapacks that use different versions of a library, the conflicting versions overwrite each other and can cause issues. 'Versioned' libraries are formatted to prevent this problem by preventing files from being overwritten and ensuring the latest version of the library is used. 'Static' libraries are unversioned, but are intended to never change so they can't cause conlicts.
